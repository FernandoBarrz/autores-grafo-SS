## About the project
> A command line app that automates the process of registering collaboration between authors' research work in the form of a graph (data structure). This app uses some input files containing researchers' names from the institute and the bibliographic information gathered from published materials and then it process it to generate a undirected weighted graph representing those collaborations.

__Project for the [Biomedical Research Institute](https://www.biomedicas.unam.mx/)__
